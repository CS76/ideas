## Product Overview

Users want to have a convenient and powerful group chat comparable to the market competitors. But beside these standard operations they want to have greater control over the content in their chat feeds ensuring a positive experience. We can give users that control by providing them with a suite of moderation tools. Our moderation tools will enable users to define their own content rules or subscribe to a moderation provider to do it for them. A marketplace will ultimately exist where users can choose from a range of moderation providers.
