## Product Overview
For a democracy where every member understands basic about every subject required for senstive actions inside the network is utopic. 
As Status Network decisions would be democratic for the users of the platform, a optional voting capability would be given to SNT owners, where they could set their delegate, or vote by themselfs.
When users don't vote and don't delegate, their influence would be delegated to SGT (Status Genesis Tokens) owners consensus.
