## Preamble

    Idea: #999-iterative-research-retrospective
    Title: Establish a self-learning research process
    Status: Draft
    Created: 2018-04-19

## Summary

Modern development processes often use some kind of agile process, e.g. Scrum. Core of all those
processes is to act in iterations, review those, learn from succuess and failures, improve, and
start the next iteration. Opposite to this research often is focussed on an explorative journey
towards their goals.

This swarm is focussed on the establishment of a similar iterative-incremental process in research.
